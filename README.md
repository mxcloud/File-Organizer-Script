# File-Organizer-Script
This Python script organizes files in a specified directory into subfolders based on their file type. It is designed to handle images, GIFs, and videos, sorting them into 'Pictures', 'GIFS', and 'Videos' folders, respectively. Additionally, any file exceeding a size threshold is moved into a 'TOO_BIG' subfolder within these respective folders.
